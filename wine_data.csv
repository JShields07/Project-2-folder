California’s hot and dry climate can be hard on the thinned-skinned, early ripening Pinot Noir. It grows best in areas close to the ocean, and you can’t get much closer than Sonoma Coast. Cool air and fog preserve the freshness of the grape, while the warm California sunshine develops its elegant flavors. Alluvial soils with volcanic content create a balance of water retention and drainage. Sufficient drainage is helpful for controlling vine vigor, but soils that retain enough water are useful during a long and dry growing season.

Harvest happens at night by hand. Bunches are sorted prior to fermentation to retain only the best quality fruit. Fermentation occurs with a mix of destemmed berries and whole clusters in small, open-topped tanks. A gentle punching down of the cap into the fermenting juice extracts color and texture from the skins. After a two-week post-fermentation maceration the wine is released from the skins. Maturation occurs in French oak barrels."

The Napa Valley isn’t all valley. Vineyards extend from the alluvial soils of the valley floor up into the mountains on either side, the Mayacamas in the west and the Vaca Range in the east. Grapes grown on the shallow, rocky soils on hillsides above the morning fog tends to develop smaller berries and thicker skins, creating concentrated, full-bodied wines with a firm, ripe tannic structure. The higher elevation also exposes the bunches to cooler mountain air, especially at night. This drop in temperature preserves acidity, thus balancing the wine’s ripe fruit intensity and luscious texture.

The grapes that go into this wine come from a single vineyard, highelevation site that is made up of a patchwork of blocks on steep hillsides and terraces. Bunches are hand-harvested in the evening, and brought to the winery where the grapes are sorted, destemmed and loaded into small opened topped fermenters. Fermentation occurs with natural yeasts. A post fermentation maceration occurs to extract more flavor, color and structure. Maturation occurs in 100% new French barrique for up to 18 months.

The grapes are hand-harvested in the early morning and then delivered to the winery where they are sorted, de-stemmed and crushed.

257,90+ Cellars Lambrusco Lot 172,Italy,90 Cellars,"Sparkling Red Wine, Sparkling Wine",,8%,,,,,,5,1,$10.99 ,,"The often misunderstood Lambrusco is frothy and delicious. It is made from Lambrusco grapes that are planted on the Apennine foothills in the south of Emilia-Romagna in soils comprised of sand, silt and marl. The sloping vineyards and slightly heavier soils produce concentrated wines that are rich in flavor and often accompanied by some sweetness.

Similar to Prosecco, the wine is made using the Charmat method. The first fermentation occurs at low temperatures, which preserves the wine's fresh red fruit aromas and minimizes the extraction of tannin from the skins. The second fermentation occurs in a closed tank where CO2 is captured by the liquid infusing the wine with a gentle fizz.

The DOC region of Lambrusco Grasparossa di Castelvetro is the furthest south in Emilia-Romagna. By many it is considered the finest DOC for Lambrusco. Its more moderate climate, less fertile soils and earlier ripening clones produces lower yields of fully mature grapes resulting in wines rich in color, aroma and flavor.

Deep purple-red in color, with aromas of fresh strawberries and violets. Take a sip and a light touch of effervescence accompanied by flavors of plum and wild berries emerge. This refreshing, versatile wine pairs fantastically with the lightest of appetizers or the heartiest cured meats and aged cheeses.

259,90+ Cellars Organic Rosé (Lot 169),France,90 Cellars,"Pink Wine, Ros Wine",,12%,,,,,,5,1,$13.99 ,,"Lot 169 is made from a blend of 100% organically farmed Grenache and Cinsault grapes from France’s Languedoc. The vines are planted in soils comprised of clay, limestone and gravel located in the northern, hillier reaches of the region. During the growing season, a cool breeze flows from the heights of the Cevennes to allow for more gradual ripening and to protect the vines against disease. The grapes are hand harvested, destemmed and crushed, mixing the skins with the juice. After a few hours the juice and skins are separated and the wine is fermented under cool temperatures to preserve fresh berry and floral aromas. The wine spends a few months on the fine lees before racking and bottling.

Simply put, to be called an organic wine, a wine must be produced with certified organic grapes. And to achieve that, a vineyard must implement an entirely different set of practices to maintain their vines. This is more labor intensive and costly. So why are more wineries converting to organic viticulture? In short, the overuse of chemicals releases toxins into the vine, soil and water and can be unhealthy especially for vineyard workers. To reduce these risks, and to maintain biodiversity in the vineyard, many farmers have become more conservative regarding their use of chemicals, and some are even converting to organic viticulture.

In order to encourage more farmers to farm organically, they need to be able to charge a little more for their grapes and wine. This wine, Lot 169, is helping more farmers have the means and the confidence to convert to organic farming.

TASTING NOTES
Pale pink in color with aromatic notes of strawberries, raspberries, violets and citrus rind with a subtle salty savoriness. The wine is medium bodied and round with concentrated berry fruit and citrus flavors that evolve into a long finish accented with hints of fresh fennel.
